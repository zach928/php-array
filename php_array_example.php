     Q. 1. 
     $color = array('white', 'green', 'red', 'blue', 'black');
     Write a script which will display the following string - Go to the editor 
    "The memory of that scene for me is like a frame of film forever frozen at that moment: the red carpet, the green lawn, the white house, the leaden sky. The new president and his first lady. - Richard M. Nixon"
    and the words 'red', 'green' and 'white' will come from $color.
